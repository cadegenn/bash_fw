## Changelog

This tiny linux bash framework is a rolling release program. That's why you won't see version numbers but serialized date in the form 'YYYmmdd.HHMM' instead.

### 2017

  * add efunctions.rc to group e*() functions with no dependancies for underlying OS
  * begin support for custom themes
